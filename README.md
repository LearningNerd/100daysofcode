# 100daysofcode

Coding for (at least) an hour every day for 100 days!

## Guidelines/Goals
  - My real goal here is just to get back into the habit of learning and building things!
  - Every single day: make something and learn something new (related to comptuer science or programming).
    - A perfect 100 day streak is *not* the goal. The goal is just to get into the habit.
    - I'm aiming to be *prolific*, not perfect.
  - ...will add more details here later :) first, coding time!

## Project 1: 100 Days of Code Tracker

A don't-break-the-chain style app to keep track of my progress with the #100DaysOfCode.

### Day 1: 2018-05-22

**Finished:**
  - Public URL hosted on GitHub: https://learningnerd.com/100daysofcode/
  - Set up Firebase
    - Database schema: users/*uid*/*date like 2018-05-22*/*data for each field*
    - Save data as an object under the key for each day, under each user
    - For days with no progress, key has value of `false`
  - User login with GitHub (via Firebase)
  - After logging in, display form:
    - Heading: Did you code today?
    - Two buttons: yes or no (but "no" doesn't do anything yet!)
    - Three form fields: link to project, link to tweet, notes
  - Save data into Firebase on form submission

<hr/>

### Day 2: 2018-05-23

**Finished:**
  - Generate today's date string ("2018-05-22") dynamically!
  - Save user data into the Firebase path for the current day dynamically
  - Pull data for the current day and display it in the form fields (so they're easily editable)
  - Clear form fields on logout
  - On auth state change, toggle login/logout button
  - By default, show nothing but the login button; after login, show next views
  - If no data exists for the current day, display "Did you code today?" with yes/no buttons
    - Yes: Display form to enter progress
    - No: Save "null" to current date location in database, and display an inspirational message
  - Otherwise if data already exists for current day, display progress form
  - Created a simple CSS grid of elements generated with JavaScript, one for each of the 100 days. All hard-coded for now!

**#TIL:**
  - The `fr` unit in CSS is super cool -- it stands for a part (or *fraction*) of the available space!
  - Finally using CSS Grids again

**Resources on CSS Grids:**
  - https://gridbyexample.com/examples/
  - https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/

<hr/>

### Day 3: 2018-05-24

**Finished:**
  - Make the progress grid dynamic: display a green box for each completed day, or a grey box for all future days  
  - Grid is only visible if user is logged in
  - Add a modal that appears when clicking each day, displaying information for that day (date, project link, and tweet link)
  - Modal disappers when clicking outside of it
  
**#TIL:**
  - Messed around with the Performance tab in Chrome DevTools -- so much more to learn here!
  - Render-Blocking CSS: https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/blocking-resources 

<hr/>

### Day 4: 2018-05-25

**Finished:**
  - Show confirmation that data was successfully saved!

**Explored:**
  - Took a look at the Glitch starter template for a Node.js app with SQLite database. (Had some glitches though, didn't seem to work!)

<hr/>

### Day 5: 2018-05-26

No coding today! Too busy hiking around in the woods and hanging out with friends (holiday weekend). Good excuse for a break. :) Like I said, perfection isn't the goal here; it's fine if I miss a few days. But just like going to the gym, my rule of thumb is to only skip one day at a time -- *maybe* two -- but never more than two days in a row. I'd love to have a 95% ratio of coding days to break days, but honestly, *anything* more than I've been doing would be a big win!

<hr/>

### Day 6: 2018-05-27

**Finished:**  
  - Restructure database: users/*uid*/*day number starting at 0*/*data for each field*
  - When saving progress for the day, hide the form

<hr/>

### Day 7: 2018-05-28

Another day off, since I was so tired after returning home from the weekend trip with friends. I was also feeling pretty down / a bit depressed, as I often do after a trip. I had a lot of negative thoughts around missing a day, losing momentum, feeling like I'm not doing enough or being lazy and so on. Had to keep reminding myself that it's OK to take breaks. Besides, that's why I wrote in my list of goals for this 100 days challenge that perfection is *not* the goal here.

<hr/>

### Day 8: 2018-05-29
    
**Finished:**
  - Remove Firebase forEach section now that the data is given as an array (thanks to restructuring things the other day)
  - For missed days, show a red box in the grid showing user's progress
  - Cleanup: read from database only once (instead of twice!)

<hr/>

### Day 9: 2018-05-30

**Finished:**
  - Update database structure again, adding a `goalMet` field to all entries and including the date for missed days
  - Replace dates with timestamps in the database
  - Start adding some helper functions to work with dates

<hr/>

### Day 10: 2018-05-31

**Finished:**
  - Review date arithmetic! (Remembered that math trick to find midnight of the current day.)
  - Finish a couple helper functions to check if a given timestamp falls on today, yesterday, or any time before yesterday.
  - Confirm that the Firebase server saves the current timestamp (in UTC) when inserting this placeholder:  `firebase.database.ServerValue.TIMESTAMP`  

<hr/>

### Day 11: 2018-06-01

**Finished:**
  - Update database structure:
    - Add timestamps and remove date strings
    - Remove `goalMet` property
    - Instead of objects, just use a timestamp as the value for missed days (to more easily check the date of the most recent entry)
  - Refactor `createGridBoxes()`:
    - Use `.forEach()` instead of a `for` loop
    - Simplify logic to identify "success" vs "missed" days
    - Only iterate through database entries (Silly me, iterating through all 100 days for no reason!)
  - Start making function to add entries for any previous days that were missed

<hr/>

**Next:**    
  - When displaying user progress, insert `false` value into the database for any previous days that were missed
    - Calculate the next indexes and dates by comparing current date to the latest database entry    
          
  - When saving progress for the day, save user data under the day's index
    - Calculate the index of the current day (based on index of the latest database entry?)
  - When saving progress for the day, update the current day in the grid view
  
  - Bug: if user clicks *between* each box in the grid, modal appears -- it shouldn't!
  - If user doesn't have any data saved yet, display an inspirational message to get started with their 100 days challenge! 
  - Save a record in the database for any previous days that were missed  
  - Switch back to using VS Code rather than doing all development in Glitch, and use Git locally and sync directly to GitHub!
  - Set date cut-off time to something more like 2am (since I keep saving my work for the day after midnight!)
  - Either delete notes field or fix CSS so it fits in the modal

**Other feature ideas:**
  - Title of project
  - Short description of project
  - Other notes? (What did I learn that day?)
  - ...an entire blog post related to the project?
  - Video recording of that day's work.
  - Time spent studying that day?
  - Other statistics (lines of code written? etc etc) ... probably not
  - User setting for cut-off time, applying work to previous day even if after midnight
  - If user skips a day (or more) without checking in, prompt to save updates for those days as well
